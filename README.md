Using Mongoose, Node JS, Cheerio, NDTV news website is scraped and data is loaded into Mongo DB database

This is a full-stack JavaScript app built using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, HTML, and CSS. It scrapes the  [NDTV](https://ndtv.com/) homepage and stores article titles and links

## Get new articles, save favorites, and write notes

To see updated news stories, click `Get new articles` at the top of the `Home` page. To view the full article, click the `View article on NDTV` link. 

When you see an article in the list that you want to mark as a favorite, click `Save article`, and read it again by clicking `Saved articles` in the top menu bar. After you have an article in your saved list, you can comment on it by clicking `Add note`.



_Note: There is no login system, so all saved articles and comments are visible to and can be deleted by all users._
